# Poseidon

It's iOS library, which helps reduce soucre code of navigation by application.

## Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for iOS, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries in your projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

#### Podfile

To integrate Poseidon into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

target 'TargetName' do
pod 'Poseidon'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
